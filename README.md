## About

With this python library you can request data from [forecast.solar](https://forecast.solar) and see what your solar panels may produce in the coming days.

## Installation

```bash
pip install forecast-solar
```

## Data

This library returns a lot of different data, based on the API:

### Energy

- Total Estimated Energy Production - today/tomorrow (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - This Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Next Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Remaining today (kWh)

### Power

- Highest Power Peak Time - Today (datetime)
- Highest Power Peak Time - Tomorrow (datetime)
- Estimated Power Production - Now (W)
- Estimated Power Production - Next Hour (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +6 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +12 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +24 Hours (W)

### API Info

- Timezone
- Rate limit
- Account type
- Rate remaining

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from forecast_solar import ForecastSolar


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on how to use the library."""
    async with ForecastSolar(
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        latitude=52.16,
        longitude=4.47,
        declination=20,
        azimuth=10,
        kwp=2.160,
        damping=0,
        damping_morning=0.5,
        damping_evening=0.5,
        horizon="0,0,0,10,10,20,20,30,30",
    ) as forecast:
        estimate = await forecast.estimate()
        print(estimate)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
